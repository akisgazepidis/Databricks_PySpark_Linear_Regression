# Databricks_PySpark_Linear_Regression

### Goal
The goal of this repo is have a first use of Databricks, Pyspark and the implementation of a simple Linear Regression model in PySpark.
NOTE: The results of the evaluation part after the model training haven't been optimized cause the target was to have a first glimpse of Databricks and Pyspark. 

### Description
After connecting in Databricks i imported a local csv file with data from Kaggle and i created a cluster in order to work.
Some basic commands were applied in order to read, print, slice and preprocess the data through a dataframe.
Bring the data to final for for model, train, create predictions and finally evaluate the results.
